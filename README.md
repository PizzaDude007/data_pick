# Data Pick

## Overview
This is a Data Science and Data Mining web page that uses various Python libraries and frameworks for machine learning algorithms such as regression and classification methods using tree graphs and forests, as well as SVM. It also includes EDA and PCA methods for selecting and better use of data. The web page is built using Flask for the backend, Plotly and JavaScript for React and DataTables for the frontend, and Bootstrap for the styling.

## Features
- Machine learning algorithms such as regression and classification methods using tree graphs and forests, as well as SVM.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and PCA methods for selecting and better use of data.
- Interactive data visualizations using Plotly and JavaScript for React.
- Interactive data tables using DataTables.
. Responsive design using Bootstrap.
